# Concepts

* [Signal](./signal.md): The data types that can be transferred through wires.
* [Interface](./interface.md): A data structure contains forward signal, backward signal and its transfer condition.
* [Combinators](./combinator.md): The mechanism of chaining two interfaces together.
* [Modules](./module.md): A collection of combinators work together and perform a distinct task, serving as the building block for a digital circuit.
