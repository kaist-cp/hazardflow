- [Signal](./signal.md): The data types that can be transferred through wires.
- [Interface](./interface.md): Communication protocol between modules. It contains forward signal, backward signal and its transfer condition.
- [Modules](./module.md): Hardware module. It serves as the building block for a digital circuit.
- [Interface Combinators](./combinator.md): The mechanism of chaining two interfaces together.
